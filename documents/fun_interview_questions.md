# Fun interview Questions

## Someone gave Sean an elephant he couldn't sell or give away. What do he do with it?

If someone gave Sean an elephant that he couldn't sell or give away he would use it as the opportunity he's always wanted to build a butterfly garden in his backyard. He'd build the butterfly garden and then let the elephant live in it!

## If Sean could choose one song to play every time he walked into a room, what would he choose and why?

Right now, one of Sean's favorite songs is [Capaz by Alleh and Yorghaki](https://youtu.be/cMhT1SqxqHY?si=kJbBFspNZYc9fdl0). Sean especially loves this song because it also happens to be the walk up song for Carlos Narvaez, the 2025 Red Sox catcher. Sean knows he's not a professional baseball player, but the latin beat of this song also reminds him of dancing in a salsa dance group which he did in 2022 and he absolutely loved it!

## What does Sean think about when he's alone in the car?

When I'm alone in a car, I'm nearly always listening to an audiobook. As of writing this, I'm listening to "The Art Of Spending Money" by Morgan Housel, whose other book "The Psychology of Money" I also really enjoyed. Some other books I've listened to recently include "Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life" by Luke Burgis, and "Supercommunicators" by Charles Duhigg. I nearly always go for non-fiction books - especially business, economics, philosophy, and also religion.

## If Sean could have any superhero power, what would it be and why?

If Sean could have a superpower, it would be to speak every language. Sean loved learning spanish when he spent about a year abroad in Nicaragua and Argentina during college. He loved the experience of learning and connecting with people through language. Sean believes that leaning a new language has helped him professionally because so much of his work has involved understanding the full cultural context of a business group, such as programmers or people who represent the business interest.

Yes, one show that Sean watched recently and enjoyed a lot was called "Death by Lightening" which is about the election of President James Garfield which is told in parallel with the story of his assassin, Charles Guiteau.
