# Fun interview Questions

## Someone gives you an elephant you can't sell or give away. What do you do with it?

If someone gave me an elephant that I couldn't sell or give away I would use it as the opportunity I've always wanted to build a butterfly garden in my backyard. I'd build the butterfly garden and then let the elephant live in it!

## If you could choose one song to play every time you walked into a room, what would you choose and why?

Right now, one of my favorite songs is [Capaz by Alleh and Yorghaki](https://youtu.be/cMhT1SqxqHY?si=kJbBFspNZYc9fdl0). I especially love this song because it also happens to be the walk up song for Carlos Narvaez, the 2025 Red Sox catcher. I know I'm not a professional baseball player, but the latin beat of this song also reminds me of dancing in a salsa dance group which I did in 2022 and it was a blast!

## What do you think about when you're alone in a car?

When I'm alone in a car, I'm nearly always listening to an audiobook. As of writing this, I'm listening to "The Art Of Spending Money" by Morgan Housel, whose other book "The Psychology of Money" I also really enjoyed. Some other books I've listened to recently include "Wanting: The Power of Mimetic Desire in Everyday Life" by Luke Burgis, and "Supercommunicators" by Charles Duhigg. I nearly always go for non-fiction books - especially business, economics, philosophy, and also religion.

## If you could have any superhero power, what would it be and why?

If I could have a superpower, it would be to speak every language. Learning spanish has been one of the most fun pleasures of my life. I spent about a year abroad in Nicaragua and Argentina in college and loved the experience of learning and connecting with people through language, I would love to be able to connect with more people to learn about their cultures around the world.

## Tell me a dad joke

This is my current favorite dad joke: I went to the doctor's office and told him that I broke my arm in three places. The doctor responded: "Well then don't go to those places!"

## Are you a gatherer or a hunter?

I consider myself to be more of a hunter. This is because I have a bias for action over reflection and I am patient to get something that is valuable.

## Getting to know you

Yes, one show that I watched recently and enjoyed a lot was called "Death by Lightening" which is about the election of President James Garfield told in parallel with the story of his assassin Charles Guiteau. I enjoyed this movie because it was well done and because it taught me about a super interesting time in American history that I did not know as much about.
