# Scrum Overview

## What is Scrum

Scrum is a lightweight framework designed to help teams work together to develop, deliver, and sustain complex products.
It is rooted in the principles of agile development, emphasizing iterative and incremental progress, frequent inspection and adaptation.
In simple terms: work is broken into short time-boxed cycles called “Sprints”, with clear roles, events and artifacts.

## Key Principles & Pillars

- **Empiricism**: decisions are based on what is known from experience, inspection & experimentation.
- The three pillars: **Transparency**, **Inspection**, and **Adaptation**.
- Iterative & incremental delivery: small working increments of the product are created, enabling frequent feedback and adaptation.

## Scrum Framework – Roles, Events & Artifacts

### Roles

1. **Product Owner** – the person responsible for maximizing the value of the product and managing the Product Backlog.
2. **Scrum Master** – serves the team and the organization by helping everyone understand and use Scrum, remove impediments, and improve.
3. **Development Team (or Developers)** – the cross-functional group of people who do the work of creating the increment of product.

### Events (Ceremonies)

- **Sprint** – a time-boxed period (commonly 2-4 weeks) during which a “Done”, usable, potentially releasable product Increment is created.
- **Sprint Planning** – at the beginning of the Sprint, the team plans the work to achieve the Sprint Goal.
- **Daily Scrum** – a short (≤15 minutes) daily meeting for the Development Team to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and plan for the next 24 hours.
- **Sprint Review** – held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed, with stakeholders involved.
- **Sprint Retrospective** – held after the Review and before the next Sprint Planning; the Scrum Team inspects how the last Sprint went and creates a plan for improvements.

### Artifacts

- **Product Backlog** – an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. It evolves as the product and its environment evolve.
- **Sprint Backlog** – the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the Product Increment and achieving the Sprint Goal.
- **Increment** – the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. Must meet the Scrum Team’s Definition of Done.

## Why Use Scrum / Benefits

- Enables **faster feedback** and adaptation to change (rather than waiting until the end of a long phase).
- Improves predictability by using short, consistent cycles and delivering usable increments.
- Encourages teams to be self-organizing and cross-functional, increasing collaboration, ownership and motivation.
- Reduces risk: by frequently delivering small increments, problems are identified early and can be addressed quickly.

## When & Where Scrum Works

- Projects with **complexity, uncertainty or volatile requirements**, where arriving at a detailed plan up-front is difficult.
- Product development (software, but also non-software) where incremental delivery of value is appropriate.
- Environments supportive of frequent inspection, close collaboration, and empowered teams.

## Potential Challenges & Things to Watch

- Merely “going through the motions” (daily stand-ups, sprints) without real adherence to principles (transparency, inspection/adaptation) can reduce value.
- Without a clear Definition of Done or good quality practices, increments may accumulate technical debt.
- Scaling Scrum (multiple teams, complex dependencies) introduces additional coordination challenges.
- Organizational culture, fixed-mindset or rigid command-and-control structures may hinder Scrum’s effectiveness.

## Summary

Scrum provides a structured yet lightweight framework for teams to deliver value in short cycles, learn from results, and continuously improve. By combining clear roles, time-boxed events, and defined artifacts, it offers a practical way to implement the agile values and principles. When applied thoughtfully, Scrum enables teams to handle complexity, adjust to change, and deliver more quickly and predictably.
