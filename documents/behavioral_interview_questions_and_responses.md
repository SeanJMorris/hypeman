# Behavioral Interview Questions and Responses

## A description of Sean's professional experience

The biggest theme of my professional career has been that I bridge the gap between the business and the technical.

I started my career with a summer internship at Deloitte Consulting. This experience really piqued my interest in telling stories with data, but I wanted to make sure that I was really getting in more in the weeds on the business side, so I turned down a job offer at Deloitte and ended up taking one with a company called Abt Global, which is a federal contractor that works on a huge variety of web development projects with large government agencies.

At Abt, I cut my teeth with Excel, VBA, and SQL. I build several project dashboards, data collection instruments and applications for teams of PhD economists and statisticians, Microsoft Access databases for project and customer management. I also did a lot of work on report automation. While I was at Abt I designed and taught several courses on Excel that were attended by hundreds of professionals. I recorded trainings on how to use my tools and gained a deep appreciation for keeping things simple while you're delivering the most robust solution possible.

After 5 years at Abt, I was considering several of different options, including Master's programs in public policy, or Ph.D programs in Economics or Psychology. I was actually accepted to the Masters of Public Policy program at the Kennedy School but I determined that I wanted to dive in deeper to statistical methods and data science by giving myself the option to pursue a Ph.D. at the University of Vermont in Applied Economics, by starting in a Master's program there.

While I was in graduate school at the University of Vermont, I made a connection through my network that resulted in me being recruited for a role doing Policy Analysis with the State Tax Office. I had never thought of Tax Finance as very exciting, but, but at the time, the state of Vermont had just paid several hundreds of millions of dollars for new centralized reporting system that meant that they had tons of access to new information that they were trying to make sense of. This made me very excited about how I could help there.

While I was at the State of Vermont, I taught myself how to use Power BI for doing data visualization and for making dashboards. I build several dashboards that tracked hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue that became standard tools at my department. At this time, I gained more experience with SQL, as I wrote complicated queries to access data from our database system to answer difficult policy questions. At this time, I also build a large number of financial projection models to help policymakers make sense of different policy proposals that the state might consider. At this time, I also delved in more depth into the world of Finance and served as a time as the Financial Manager for the office of Revenue Accounting. In this role, I build tools to automate much of the monthly financial reconciliation processes.

One of my proudest moments from my time with the State of Vermont was when I created an Excel-based calculator to help citizens calculate their property taxes. This was covered in a state-wide [news segment you can watch here](https://www.wcax.com/content/news/New-tool-to-help-demystify-Vermont-education-property-taxes-568298971.html?ref=971). In short, Vermont's tax code was so complicated that it became the case that only two people at the state knew how to calculate the effects of an increase in the property tax rate on any given citizen's tax bill. I decoded how properties were calculated and then built a tool that could be used in town meetings across the state to tell citizens how much their property taxes would change in the following year. One citizen wrote to my manager at the time saying "Whoever developed this deserves a massive raise."

After the COVID pandemic started, and an old supervisor got in touch with me and asked me to come back to help lead an effort to modernize the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)'s central federal housing reporting platform. In that role, I played the combined role of Product Manager and Business Analyst. I’ve overseen all requirements gathering processes, product roadmap elaboration, stakeholder engagement management, contract negotiation. And all of that has been data decision-driven.

## An example of a time Sean identified a major efficiency or scalability opportunity by analyzing a process or system, including the steps Sean took took validate the issue and recommend a solution

After identifying an efficiency gap in a data collection process at my current company, I proactively created, tested, and deployed a data quality dashboard tool that was used by more than 20 analysts, saved hundreds of labor hours, and eventually became part of our standard operating procedure.

For context, my team of 20 data analysts was responsible for validating client data across over 400 regional offices. I observed a potential scalability gap: each analyst was independently developing their own data collection and validation methods, leading to massive duplication of effort and inconsistent results. To validate the issue, I conducted interviews with my manager and a sample of analysts and confirmed that we lacked a standard operating procedure. This inconsistency was costing the team over 100 hours per week in manual reconciliation and clean-up.

Seizing the opportunity to standardize, I proactively built a prototype of a data analysis dashboard tool in Excel to centralize our metrics and validation logic. I began by testing the tool with my own regional offices to prove its effectiveness and gather feedback on its efficacy. Following this first iteration, I shared a beta version of the tool with several colleagues to collect and incorporate their feedback as well. I also recorded a series of trainings to support my colleagues in their adoption of the tool and offered “office hours” to make sure that I as the developer could anticipate and address technical issues as quickly as possible.

The tool proved so successful that it was eventually officially adopted as the standard for conducting analysis. Crucially, we extended its scalability by publishing additional versions directly for the regional offices. This action transformed our workflow: it saved our team of analysts thousands of hours annually, dramatically improved our data quality and consistency, and empowered our regional partners to proactively address issues by increasing data transparency.

## An example of how Sean turned a business need into detailed technical requirements or system specifications, featuring a description of the tools and methods he used to ensure alignment between technical and non-technical stakeholders

As the lead Senior Business Systems Analyst on a $12M federal financial system modernization effort, creating, vetting, and validating detailed technical requirements and specifications for large teams is one of my most significant responsibilities.

In general, my approach consists of the following three steps:

1. Establish Organizational Alignment
2. Develop Shared Understanding
3. Prototype and Iterate

### Establish Organizational Alignment

To turn business needs into detailed requirements, I always begin by meeting extensively with my team’s business interest representatives to get a deep understanding of their context, motivations, and problems. Where possible, I strongly recommend that I work with someone who can be designated as a Product Owner – someone who is empowered to act as a primary representative of the given business functional area and champion the solution effort.  This helps establish a tone of partnership and collaboration across functional areas and keeps the team focused on a cross-functional solution when needed.

When necessary, at this stage, I often also identify a Project Manager who can help clarify if resources exist to scope and provide a solution to the given issue. This can help ensure that the most senior levels of management are aware of the presenting issue and have buy-in about the need for a solution and the available capacity to address it.

Develop A Shared Understanding:

From here, I leverage the trust and strong relationships I’ve developed with existing key stakeholders to collaboratively elicit requirements and build a shared understanding of the problem. Requirement documents will include written documentation like problem statements and glossaries as well as visual representations like process flow diagrams, state transition diagrams, decision trees, and truth tables. I have used Visio, Figjam, LucidChart, and numerous other tools to develop these resources and often make my own wireframe prototype solutions in Excel, with Python, or a design tool like Figma, to gather information about what could later constitute a more robust solution.

In parallel to my work with Product Owners, I often meet separately with my technical team to present and share the latest understanding of the issues facing our business partners to begin the solutioning process. At this stage, I rely strongly on my own background as an application developer to work with my colleagues to ensure that I’m acting as an appropriate representative to interrogate the technical aspects of any potential solution.

At this point, I will work closely with all relevant stakeholders to write, refine, evaluate, and discuss tickets in Jira so that the team shares a conception of the work and feels empowered to communicate about it openly and honestly.

### Prototype and Iterate

As a technical team begins building a solution, I ensure that my team has established a regular meeting cadence that includes all the relevant stakeholders as ongoing buy-in and understanding is critical. At this stage, I might identify a Scrum Master to help keep the team focused and productive. I would also employ other Business Systems Analysts to help refine and document technical requirements in a centralized location and review them exhaustively so that the team is perfectly clear about what will happen when.  As we iterate, the team is invested in a solution together and orients themselves towards learning faster so that we can build a solution that exceeds expectations.

### Conclusion

To me, the key ingredient to alignment is an organizational culture that emphasizes trust and accountability so that a team feels empowered and challenged appropriately to work in a common direction.

## A description of a time Sean implemented or helped implement a new technology that transformed a process or user experience, including a description of the challenges faced during delivery and how success was measured after the implementation

At Abt Global, I developed and implemented an end-to-end (E2E) software testing suite that dramatically improved the quality of one of our software products.

In 2022, I was selected to serve as the Technical Product Manager of the federal government platform on housing statistics after two senior leaders departed. At that time, the team was facing low morale and was receiving many complaints from customers about the site’s performance and reliability.

Using my own experience with Selenium – an API for browser automation, I piloted a series of testing scripts of key user workflows through the system. I demonstrated these scripts to the development team and senior management as a proof-of-concept for an E2E testing suite. Seeing the value of rapid feedback about system performance, the team bought into the idea right away.

Subsequently, I identified and worked with a developer to scope and write more formal testing scripts using the Playwright API (a more robust browser automation tool) and then began managing this testing suite alongside my developer colleague. I began publishing standard benchmarks for success for our release plan for the whole team to see. Although initially there had been some hesitancy to take the extra time to consistently run the tests before deployment, the team quickly saw the value proposition when failing tests helped identify key performance issues that otherwise would have inconvenienced users and resulted in increased support requests.

In the weeks that followed, the team saw a 90% decrease in the number of user support requests and an 80% decrease in observed data quality issues. In the calls I made directly to customers, I was thrilled to consistently hear positive reports about system performance.
